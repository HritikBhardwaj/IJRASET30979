Machine learning is modern and highly sophisticated technological applications became a huge trend in the health care industry. It provides methods, techniques and tools that can help in solving diagnostic problems in a variety of medical domains e.g. prediction of disease progression, extraction of medical knowledge for outcome research, therapy planning and support, and for the overall patient management. In this paper, various machine learning algorithms has been used for developing efficient decision support that can be used in healthcare applications. Cancer has been the leading cause of death worldwide for many years. The objective of this study is to diagnose and predict the possibility of occurrence of three most common types of cancer including Lung Cancer,  Breast Cancer and Prostate Cancer using various Machine Learning supervised algorithms like Logistic regression, Naive Bayes classification, Kernel support vector classification , Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and XG Boost Classifier.
